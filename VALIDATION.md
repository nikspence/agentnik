# Baseline validation

Validated on Windows on 2026-11-08 using Python 3.15 and PySide6 6.12.0.

## Passed

- All 23 standard-library and offscreen Qt tests passed. Coverage includes protocol serialization/streaming, decisions, independent tabs, cancellation, prompts, attachments, themes, storage isolation, and Agentnik-scoped credential-store calls.
- Compile checks passed for `agentnik`, `tests`, and `tools`. Source launcher help passed.
- The light/dark wordmark and temporary-data welcome screenshots were visually inspected during baseline creation. The supplied robot colors are preserved; `agent` follows the theme and `nik` is warm red.
- `pip wheel . --no-deps --wheel-dir dist` built `agentnik-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`. The wheel installed into the local `.venv` without installing runtime dependencies again; existing PySide6/keyring dependencies are shared through system site packages.
- The installed package was imported with source-directory imports excluded. All seven packaged branding assets were present; SVG and PNG decoding passed.
- The installed application's entry point ran the offscreen event loop and exited successfully with temporary storage and mocked environment/endpoint discovery. Application/organization identity and the temporary history database were verified. The harness explicitly closed its database before deleting the temporary directory.
- Intended source files were audited for obsolete branding, private development endpoints, machine-specific paths, and common credential patterns. No matches were found. This is a targeted scan, not a guarantee against every possible secret format.
- The MIT license matches the supplied source verbatim, including Copyright (c) 2026 Nikolaus Spence. Project metadata identifies Nikolaus Spence as author.
- This repository was initialized independently, with no inherited history or configured remote.

## Limits

No live inference or provider compatibility checks were run. Native interactive Windows use, macOS/Linux runtime behavior, frozen PyInstaller distributions, installers, and signing remain unverified. A Python wheel is not a frozen desktop distribution.

The default sandbox process setup still failed after the trust restart. Checks completed through the approved escalation path; Git commands used a repository-scoped ownership trust override without changing global Git settings.

Web research remains planned in `AGENTNIK_PLAN.md`. The next implementation milestone is B, managed research; the first browsing release still requires both routes and tested routing/fallback behavior.
